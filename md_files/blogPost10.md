New Project I am excited about 

08-31-2024

Recently, the company my brother works for in Brazil got in contact with me
about the possibility of me creating a product for them. And after listening to teh specifics and asking
them to give me a week to asses the length of the project I concluded that while it would be possible, I feel it would
be too heavy of a load to take while studying.

Still I liked the idea somewhat and decided to make my own version of it just to display on projects, I don't plan
to sell it or anything.

So my most recent project that I have just undertook is to create, as I put on my readme, a "visualized node-based, tree-structured hierarchical relational database model".

Super excited, basically I will use Django for the backend, have a some models and objects that can be created and they all have this tree like relationship to each other, and it can be visualized in a pretty structure using React Flow.

Lets see how the progress will look for it in the future.
