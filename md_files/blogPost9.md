Some minor updates

08-24-2024

Nothing grand but here are some thinsg i have been doing as of late. 

* I've reached 139 job applications.

* Pretty much completed my portfolio website. I think there are some minor things here and there that I would like to update such as the contact me section and some fonts, but in the meantime it is ok.

* The JFS Navigator is looking good at the moment. 
Here is a video of it functioning. The actual UI is prettier than this because we have already updated it since the mentioned video. Some things I need to check out on it is I'm probably gonna diminish the amount of read operations it does to the database which I have an idea for, and work on the csrf tokens.

* Finished a couple of leetcode questions. 

I never did get around to creating my own programming language, got so caught up with other stuff. Maybe after this week when I feel more done with the portfolio I'll try something simple like implementing authentication in a Django-React environment using Otka.
