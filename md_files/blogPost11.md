I wonder how many entries I can make before I slow down this site

Hey its been a while. Some things I have been up to to further my career and understanding.

* Applying to Grad school. Finished my letter of Intent and talking to some professors I work under for 
a recommendation.

* My IT job was impressed with my JFS_Navigator AI bot and would like for me to create one for their department. I made a slideshow
proposal to run them down on costs and how it would function to see if they are serious about it.

* One of my teachers would like my help in creating a script to automate the creation of text files he uses expalining chapters of a book
which he feeds into Ai voice to create a video presentation on the chapters for his class. I will be meeting tomorrow with a proposal on that.

* Other than that barely inching on my side project and of course normal school work that I have been working on such as my game development class and my web applications class with ruby on Rails.

Thats all for now.
