Is Everyone Just lucky except me?

08-19-2024

I did another coding assesment, and while it was better than my last one, I still did below
average on it. What's frustrating is hearing different people at my school who talk about being interviewed by a company and the 
company helps them out, or someone else said they were just asked to reverse a string or soemthing. It seems so bizarre how everyones experiences differ so much from mine, not in the way that everyone has different experiences but moreso in the way that I feel like somehow I might just be an unlucky guy. Things are always harder for me than everyone else, like I'm right here being asked to create 4 functions as question 1, then number 2 iterate over previous lists find people with a specific job key, and sort them by those who worked the longest in the company.

It's so hard, I don't know if I will make it and get a job as a software developer. But I'm still gonna keep trying.
