Bots and Dev Blogs

07-08-2024

Today I didn't get to work on as much things as I would have liked. I mostly finished one assistant bot in platform.openai.com website within the department of math and computings org acount. I am working on a second one to help the students with subnetting for the IT 280 class, so I am making a doc or file on the books info on that page. Only issue is that its been a while since i took that class and I think that its kinda extensive. I might meet up with the TA of that class and see if she can help guide me so the bot can ask the appropriate questions. 

The UI is done, the fucntionality and streaming, the hosting. I just wonder about the cost honestly, I wonder if its cheaper to buy a ton of plus acounts for students or just use the openAi token fees. who knows.

Last thing I might do before the night roles over is maybe host this site on github. Man I really hope making a static site on github dosen't bite me in the butt as the amount of entries increase. Sounds dumb but I am gonna link this website project on the github section for first day.
