I'm tired boss

07-25-2024

I honestly need to do a better job at writing on my blog. Here is some quick bullet points of things I have worked on this past week

* Made progress with the database navigation Bot. I believe I have finished its backend for the most part. Although I will have to go back and configure CSFR cookies for security purposes. I was getting a lot of errors with it so I decided to bypass it in the meantime. I just want to connect it to a simple fronte and see it functioning before going back and correct stuff Like which CORS origin has permission to access backend and what not later.

* Did some more leetcode. Decided to start at the very beggining again using Neetcodes roadmap which has a little map of what leetcode questions you should do and what knowledge you should have or build upon before attempting other structures or questions.

* Worked more on my portfolio site and finally figured out how to mimic a fixed video in the background with a z index of -1 while other components are overlayed "over" right below it. So some progress

* Keeping up my habit of attempting to apply to 3 or 4 jobs a day. I really need to update my linked in profile pic and add my database thing on my resume. But when i finish this site I feel I might seem like a stronger candidate. I really hope I am able to find a job, I am trying, mayb not as hard as others but certainly harder than most.

Don't know which github link to share so just take my leetcode one.
