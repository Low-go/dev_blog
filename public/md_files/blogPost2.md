Compilers and Portfolios

07-12-2024

Today I suddenly was craving to make or work on some type of project, but something backend since I have been caught up with
front end stuff quite a bit. After looking over some stuff the thing that oddly got my attention was creating my own programming language
and compiler. I had already done something similar in my "Programming languages" CS 420 class using DrRacket. But I honestly kinda want to do it again without my hand being held like last time. But this seems like such a gicantic task. I think the hardest part of most projects is the beggining,starting something from scratch, understanding commonly used libraries, the setup all that stuff. 

From what I understand I need to start by creating language syntax in some form of norm form or whatever. So first I am gonna study thta, and then
I need to look into udnerstanding and designing a lex in some programming language, I will probably do it in C++. But without even starting the project I probably spent an hour to an hour and a half reading stuff and I still feel like I don't understand it all that much.

I am okay if i give up on this since I'm tackling this kinda like my front end experience. Give it a go, fail, maybe give up for a bit, come back with a better understanding and greater ease of navigating it, so on and so forth. So the langauge syntax and the lex will be my first things I want to tackle!

Other than that I began the first steps for my portfolio site. For now I simply implemented the react-scroll library since I want the portfolio to be on one page and clicking the nav bar components will move you downwards smoothly. I just added that as a start and used some test sections spaced out from each other to test it out.

Last little bit is we had our meeting today for the widget the library wants to make. They talked about IRB, research project they wish to publish, other organizations AI usage and research and all this stuff. It was kinda daunting because I don't feel like I have a bone of buisness in me, I just want to code but before we can get to the fun part we need to take care of a ton of beauracracy and also ensure we finish the document we our bot to attempt to use embeddings on.

Last last thing I realized my writing and english have been really subpar in these past 3 entries so from now on I am going to make an attempt at writing more beautifully. Anyways thats all for today.
