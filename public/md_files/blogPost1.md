Not much but a little but of Something

07-09-2024

Didn't get up to as much as I would like. I had a meeting on my third job where they basically 
wanted me to integrate my assistant bots that I had made, so create a version that has a document
of all the databases the library has and we will most likely create a widget on the library page(like a chat window)
and students can talk about their research projects and it will give them appropriate links to a database that could help them instead
of them manually searching for one.

I am more excited to maybe use django for this functionality. Because I cant use streamlit UI for its look, 
instead I wnat to use a javascript UI for the widget but I don't want to discard the python functionalities. 
It'll be fun trying a new technology.

Other than that I finally started applying for jobs, I need to find some that would sponsor a visa 
and it took me a while but I actually found the github link to a collaboration people have where they post 
companies who have entry level software engineer positions and who sponsor visas. That repository is updated all the
time and its much more useful than any linkedin or indeed or job search website. God send that I found on instagram once
anyways ill post that repository here, it aint my github link but its a useful one.
