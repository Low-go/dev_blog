Forever without updating

11-12-2024

Long time since I have updated this. Been super caught up with school work. I am taking a web applications class where we learn and integrate rails for full stack development, and I am also taking a gaming class, 490r, wherer we are creating games using Unity and C#. 

I have not been applying to jobs like I should. I am going to try and get back into that

I was also very fortunate that i had an Interview with Family Search here at the university, it was a technical interview. They gave me a problem? to solve. The problem was similar to a codepen style development, we have a html, css and Javascript files and we are asked to create a simple single page website with some specifications and then make it behave a certain way. 

Took me about 50-55 minutes, had some hints by the interviewer. It was not insane but front end is not my forte.

I was able to solve it which is good, just waiting for a response so heres hoping. 

Below is the repository for one of the games I made its super cool but lacks a lot still. I'll explain it more in depth the next blog update.
