Job Applications/ Session Management

08-07-2024

I have applied for a total of 56 job applications, generally postings on entry level software engineer positions, mostly in the United States and some in Canada. Only received one coding exam, and 0 interviews. It is august and I graduate end of June next year, so I have around 10 months and a bit to try and find a job. I am really worried but I am trying to apply to at least 4 jobs a day. That should average 120 a month. I hope at least end of this month I can reach 100 applications.

Also I have hit a really hard standstill with my django project. I have read documentation, seen youtube videos, asked for help on stackoverflow. But for some reason I cannot implement session managment properly, every text starting a new session and it is actually driving me insane. I don't know where to go or how to fix this at the moment.
